  <p><span style="color:#0ea5e9;font-weight:bold;">Aneurysm (AAA)</span> is a condition in which the largest artery in the body bulges or enlarges. An aneurysm is defined as a dilation of an artery that increases its diameter by at least 50%. <strong>An abdominal aortic aneurysm is an enlargement of the aorta.</strong></p>
  
  <p style="font-weight:bold; color:#1e3a8a;">
    An abdominal aortic aneurysm is often due to the degeneration of the aorta, specifically the media or middle layer of the artery. Risk factors include:
  </p>
  
  <ul style="font-style:italic; margin-left:1.25rem;">
    <li>smoking</li>
    <li>peripheral arterial disease</li>
    <li>coronary artery disease</li>
    <li>hypertension</li>
    <li>genetic factors</li>
    <li>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs when the abdominal aorta balloons out due to the weakening of the wall of the artery. Dissection and rupture are potential complications of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
    <strong style="color:#1d4ed8;"> Dissection occurs when blood gets in between the layers </strong>
    of the vessel, causing the vessel to bulge out on one side. A rupture can cause life-threatening bleeding.
  </p>

  <p>
    Symptoms include abdominal pain, back pain, and a pulse near the belly button. Surgical repair is usually the recommended treatment.
